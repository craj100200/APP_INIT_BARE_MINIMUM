## Bare minimum APP_INITIALIZER
This is a bare minimum Angular project describing the use of APP_INITIALIZER 
It simply shows for alerts 1,2,3,4 in sequence and then app.component.ts constructor is called. 
This ensures that code in APP_INITIALIZER is executed before any component is loaded.

Remmber two things: 1. myFunc should return a function which returns a promise. 2. provider should use "multi : true"
